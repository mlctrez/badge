# badge

[![Go Report Card](https://badge.mlctrez.com/mlctrez/badge)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/mlctrez/badge)

A lambda function to add cache headers to goreportcard.com badges, so they refresh properly with github.com camo.

Note to self, the function url and cloudfront configuration need to be re-added if this function is deleted.
